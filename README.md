# Better - Blockchain-Based Betting App

**Better** is a decentralized betting app built on the NEAR protocol, designed to help people achieve their physical goals by betting on themselves. By leveraging $NEAR tokens, users commit to completing physical challenges and are rewarded based on their success and the performance of others.

## How It Works

1. **Set a Challenge**  
   Users set a physical challenge for themselves (e.g., run 5 miles in a week, complete 10 workouts, etc.).

2. **Place Your Bet**  
   Users place a bet using $NEAR tokens, committing to complete the challenge within a specific timeframe.

3. **Complete the Challenge**  
   If the user successfully completes their challenge, they reclaim their $NEAR tokens and earn a share of the tokens from users who did not succeed.

4. **Incentivized Success**  
   If a user fails to complete the challenge, their tokens are distributed among the users who completed the challenge, creating a win-win scenario that encourages everyone to succeed.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Powered**  
  Built on the NEAR blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and decentralization.
  
- **Incentive-Driven**  
  Succeed in your challenge to earn both your bet back and a share of the pool from those who didnâ€™t.

- **Personal Accountability**  
  Turn your goals into commitments by betting real value on your ability to follow through.
